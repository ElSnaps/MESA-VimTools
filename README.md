## MESA-VimTools
General purpose nvim tooling used on Mesa. nvim that goes (mostly) anywhere.

The general idea is that the same setup should work anywhere, especially
when working in servers over ssh, it's very nice to just have your text
editor and tooling consistently work wherever you go.

## Installation
